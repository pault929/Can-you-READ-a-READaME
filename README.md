# Read Me Generator:
The following link takes you to My Read-me:
https://pault929.github.io/Can-you-READ-a-READaME/

You will have to have VSCode to open the App.

I used Node Modules, Javascript, and JSon to deploy this app.

This app generates a Read me file by asking the user to answer a few questions.
